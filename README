A few changes to Editra.
NOTE home page is down, latest versions appear to be available at:

  * https://github.com/wxWidgets/wxPython/tree/master/wx/tools/Editra
  * https://github.com/mogaal/editra

This reports as version 0.7.20 (as of Nov 2019 both projects above
report the same version, I'm not clear what if any differences there
are between the two).

Also see https://github.com/XHermitOne/editra which appears to be the
start of Python3 support.

This branch does not have a real implementation of _winrecycle.py

Tested with

  * Windows 32-bit Python 2.7.10
  * mxMSW 2.8.12.1

To run issue:

    python editra

Under windows Profile (config) is stored in pickled (binary) file
`%APPDATA%\Editra\profiles\default.ppb`. TODO replace with json.

File loading happens via:

    src\ed_stc.py(1810)LoadFile()
      src\ed_basestc.py(843)LoadFile()
        src\ebmlib\fileimpl.py(189)SetPath()
        src\ed_txt.py(380)Read()
            DetectEncoding()
            src\ebmlib\fileimpl.py(80)DoOpen()

If DoOpen() can return a (binary) file like object - should be able
to open files using different approachs, e.g. remote ftp/scp/etc.
