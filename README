Original project pages still up:

  * https://code.google.com/archive/p/editra/
      * https://github.com/code-google-com/editra  - contains wiki export too
  * https://code.google.com/archive/p/editra-plugins/
      * https://github.com/thegooglecodearchive/editra-plugins - contains wiki export too

This reports as version 0.7.20 (as of Nov 2019 both projects above
report the same version, I'm not clear what if any differences there
are between the first two - the later is new as of end of Nov 2019).


This branch does not have a real implementation of _winrecycle.py
See https://github.com/editra-org/editra/issues/1

Tested with

  * Windows 32-bit Python 2.7.10
  * mxMSW 2.8.12.1

To run issue:

    python editra

See https://github.com/clach04/editra-plugins/blob/wiki/DevelopingPlugins.md for plugin dev notes.
NOTE PYTHONPATH only needs to be setup for the initial develop call, Editra does not need this setting for runtime.

Under windows Profile (config) is stored in pickled (binary) file
`%APPDATA%\Editra\profiles\default.ppb`. TODO replace with json.

File loading happens via:

    src\ed_stc.py(1810)LoadFile()
      src\ed_basestc.py(843)LoadFile()
        src\ebmlib\fileimpl.py(189)SetPath()
        src\ed_txt.py(380)Read()
            DetectEncoding()
            src\ebmlib\fileimpl.py(80)DoOpen()

If DoOpen() can return a (binary) file like object - should be able
to open files using different approachs, e.g. remote ftp/scp/etc.
